# 🧭 Project Overview

Welcome to our Hackathon project repository, organized by Lablab.AI! In this challenge, we were tasked with creating various types of agents that can carry out several tasks. Our team has developed a multi-agent system that can efficiently perform tasks in a simulated environment. This project showcases our innovative approach to problem-solving and demonstrates the power of collaboration.

## 🚧 Prerequisites

Before diving into the project, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

1. Python 3.7 or higher
2. Git
3. Virtualenv (optional, but recommended)

Additionally, you'll need to install the required Python packages. You can find the list of dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file.

## 🎛 Project Setup

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hackathon-agents.git
```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install the required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the main script to see the agents in action:

```
python main.py
```
